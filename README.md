# Call Center Optimization
This project is part of the SkyHack 2.0 Hackathon, where the objective is to analyze customer call center data and propose solutions to optimize Average Handle Time (AHT), improve customer service, and enhance overall call center efficiency. The analysis focuses on understanding call reasons, handling peak hours, and proposing improvements to self-service IVR systems.

## **Project Overview**

The main objectives of the project are:

1. **Identifying Key Factors for Long AHT:**  
   Analyze agent performance, call types, and customer sentiment to discover the drivers of long AHT and AST (Average Speed to Answer).
   
2. **Clustering Call Transcripts:**  
   Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to group similar call transcripts and identify recurring issues.

3. **Optimizing Agent Allocation:**  
   Understand peak hour trends and recommend better agent distribution during high call volume periods to improve efficiency.

4. **Self-Service IVR Enhancement:**  
   Identify self-resolvable issues and propose improvements to the IVR system to handle them, thus reducing unnecessary agent intervention.
